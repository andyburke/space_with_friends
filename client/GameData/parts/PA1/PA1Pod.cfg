	description = The more scars we find on this thing the more difficult it is to believe it wasn't salvage, perhaps having been salvage because it once had much bigger scars. It came wrapped in newspaper and covered in a thick, greasy substance; even after cleaning it still smells thickly of electrical fire. Our early tests were plauged by circuit problems and mysterious, threatening-sounding choir music that led some of the maintainence crew to believe the vessel to be haunted by the spirits of its former crew. Investigating the claims just makes them harder to dismiss. We mentioned these issues to Prakasa; They got far enough through a harrowing war story to assure us the crew escaped before stopping suddenly to remind us the product had simply been damaged in shipping, but that was A)Not their problem, and B)Didn't make it any less aerodynamic. Apparently the choir is a war hymn used to coordinate vessel movements and intimidate enemy forces. We pressed as to why it was there; they suggest the last pilot just liked it. Incidentally one of the reps parted with it rather tearfully, thanking it for saving his life. It's taken a little to get her ready, but she's built like a tank and you can't beat that price!
